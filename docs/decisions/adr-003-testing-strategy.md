# ADR-003: Testing Strategy and Data Quality Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ensuring data quality is critical for our TPC-H analytics project. We need a comprehensive testing strategy that covers all aspects of data quality and maintains the integrity of our transformations.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered testing approach:

### 1. Source Data Testing

- Freshness checks on source tables
- Schema tests for data types and constraints
- Volume tests to detect significant changes

### 2. Generic dbt Tests

Implement across all models where applicable:

- `unique` - Primary key uniqueness
- `not_null` - Required fields
- `relationships` - Referential integrity
- `accepted_values` - Domain validation

### 3. Custom Data Quality Tests

#### Business Logic Tests

- Custom SQL tests for complex business rules
- Validation of calculated fields
- Cross-model consistency checks

#### Statistical Tests

- Distribution tests for numeric fields
- Outlier detection
- Trend analysis for key metrics

### 4. Data Quality Framework

We will implement custom macros for:

- Row count comparisons
- Schema change detection
- Data freshness monitoring
- Reconciliation with source systems

### Test Implementation Strategy

1. **Model Properties**

   ```yaml
   version: 2
   models:
     - name: model_name
       tests:
         - unique:
             column_name: id
         - not_null:
             column_name: required_field
         - relationships:
             field: foreign_key
             to: ref('other_model')
             field: id
   ```

2. **Custom Test Structure**
   ```sql
   -- tests/specific/test_model_assertion.sql
   SELECT *
   FROM {{ ref('model_name') }}
   WHERE -- test condition
   ```

### Severity Levels

- `error`: Failed tests stop deployment
- `warn`: Issues are logged but don't stop deployment

### Testing Schedule

- CI/CD: Basic tests run on every PR
- Daily: Full test suite runs
- Weekly: Extended statistical tests

## Consequences

- Early detection of data quality issues
- Increased confidence in data accuracy
- Clear documentation of business rules
- Automated quality control process
- Potential increase in development time
- Need for ongoing test maintenance
